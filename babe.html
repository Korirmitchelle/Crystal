      <h2>Monkey,</h2>
      <p>Merry Christmas! Normally, there's so much I want to say to you, well but I can't so today I'll try. Well, I miss you a lot, I think about you all the time and can't wait to see you again.
      As the year ends I'd like you to know that you're the happiest thing that has happened to me this year.
<br><br>Let me end this with a cliche thought. Nothing is perfect. I'm that nothing, and you're my everything, because with you, everything just seems so perfect.(So stolen :) )</p>
